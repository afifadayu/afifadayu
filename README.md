# Hello! I'm Dayu:grinning:

A double major student in Computer Science and Statistics who is interested in technology, data analytics, design (ex. UI/UX design, graphic design, and content creative), organization, and people development fields. I have a lot of happiness when I learn new things. \
Previously, I was an organizational activist, a chairman of the student association, joined several committees, and worked part-time as a front-end developer :sunflower:

Besides that, I love music and video games to make my works better.
